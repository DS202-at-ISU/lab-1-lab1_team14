Process for myself: 
1. I entered the repo from my team on GitHub and copied the link
2. After creating a new project, I copied the link from GitHub 
This is where my first issue arose and I realized I hadn't fully downloaded Git onto my computer and had to refollow steps from Chapter 6. 
3. After being able to clone to my computer, I opened the readme file and made my changes. 
4. I will now commit and push it to save my edits
